# Quiz App built with React.JS

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and it allows you to take quizzes in a user-friendly interface.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Quiz App, you have two options:

* Visit the hosted version: You can visit the Quiz App at [Here](https://myquizproj-36e0e.web.app), which is hosted on Firebase. This version has already been set up for you, so you can start using it right away.

* Use the source code: Alternatively, you can use the source code in this repository to set up your own instance of the Quiz App. You will need to have Node.js and npm installed. 

Note: The source code in this repository does not include the Firebase API key. You will also need to provide your own API key and switch to your own Firebase database to use the Quiz App.
