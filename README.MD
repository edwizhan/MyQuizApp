# Quiz App

The Quiz App is a hobby project that allows users to take quizzes on coding questions. The app is available on the web, Android, and iOS platforms, and uses Firebase Firestore as the cloud database.
  
You can [visit an online web version of the Quiz App here](https://myquizproj-36e0e.web.app). It has already been set up for you, so you can start using it right away.

## Background

I created the Quiz App on the three platforms - web, Android, and iOS - as part of an evaluation of their capabilities and experiences. The evaluation was mainly focused on the client side, so all three apps use Firebase Firestore as the cloud database to minimize backend effort.
